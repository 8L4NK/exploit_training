# The best resources for learning exploit development

Exploit development is considered to be the climax in the learning path of an ethical hacker or security professional. It is strongly advisable to have mastered the basics before delving into this topic. Exploit development is hard and it’s not something you learn at school or university (usually), not something any of your geek friends will talk about all day long. Only those who are brave to study hard can achieve the joy of controlling the EIP, popping a shell and taking control of a machine while the oblivious user yells at Microsoft for the nth crash of his beloved program.

What are the prerequisites for learning about exploit development?

Well, if you want to comprehend and hopefully start developing your own exploits you should have at least a basic knowledge of x86/64 bit system architecture (Windows, Linux or Mac according to your target), low level programming, possibly assembly, C/C++ or Python is fine as well for many tasks, then you should have in mind how the computer memory works (RAM), the concept of stack, heap, CPU registers, the most common operations, system calls, segmentation fault, buffer overflow, race condition and so on. You also should be familiar with disassemblers and a background in reverse engineering or malware analysis may be useful before starting to develop your own exploits.

Let’s see some resources that can help you to be prepared before attempting the big jump onto the high level world of exploit development, the Olympus of the Godly Hackers.

x86/64 bit system architecture:
Introductory Intel x86: Architecture, Assembly, Applications, & Alliteration

Introductory Intel x86-64: Architecture, Assembly, Applications, & Alliteration

Intermediate Intel x86: Architecture, Assembly, Applications, & Alliteration

 

Assembly language:

Python:
Python has a wonderful official documentation, apart from that you can use the following books/courses:

Learn Python the hard way

How to think like a computer scientist

Learning Python

Introduction to computer science and programming using Python MITx 6.00.1x

 

When you feel comfortable with the prerequisites, then you can start learning exploit development following these great resources!

I compiled a list of books, tutorials, courses, tools and vulnerable applications that you can use for your study.
